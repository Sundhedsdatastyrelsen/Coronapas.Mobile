## What is the purpose of this app

A corona passport proves that you have been vaccinated against, have previously been infected with or have tested negative for COVID-19 within the past 72 hours (96 hours for PCR test).

The Coronapas app is designed to effectively ensure admission to restaurants and cultural venues. 

Even if you have a valid corona passport, you will still need to protect yourself and others by following the health authorities’ guidelines.
